Just a small Recipe sharing website for myself and Christina, as well as any interested friends and family.
The goal is to create a better experience than existing recipe websites - judging from the abundance of ads and mile long blog posts about the recipe, that shouldn't be too hard :)

Site has been taken down for now, I'm planning on redeploying it locally to save on costs.
